## PixelBlaster Nano PD
The PixelBlaster Nano PD is a next-generation, feature-rich WLED controller in a compact form factor (32 mm x 53mm), offering USB Power Delivery 3.1 capabilities for any addressable lighting project you may have. It has all the features of much larger boards but at a cost point you cannot ignore. 

It supports virtually all LED strips and serial matrices using single-wire protocols, such as the WS2811 and WS2812B, to SPI (clocked-data) protocol devices, such as the WS2813 and SK9822, in 5V, 12V, 24V, and higher. 

Features 

Uses the workhorse ESP32 dual-core 240MHz processor. 

Two channels of 5-volt logic-level translated outputs using ultra-fast and high-current LVC technology with matched and modeled serial inline resistors. 

Low-profile Wago push-button terminal block for easy and secure electrical connections. 

Compact form factor of 32 mm x 53 mm. 

High-quality 4-layer impedance-controlled PCB with gold-plated connectors (ENIG) for durability and corrosion resistance. 

ICS-43434 I2S 24-bit digital microphone with a sensitivity of -26 dB FS and SNR of 64 dBa. 

Onboard ATtiny1616 controller manages the AP33772S Power Delivery 3.1 sink controller. 

Input power: 5-28 volts @ 5-amp max. via USB-C connector, up to 140 watts max. 

Overvoltage and undervoltage protection on input power that shuts off power to LEDs and the board. 

Overcurrent protection with 5-amp “electronic” fuse. 

Over temperature protection of the board and moisture detection on USB-C connector. 

Onboard 34-amp AlphaSGT MOSFET "relay" that reduces current draw to just 80mA @ 5V when LEDs are turned off. 

Onboard LED reports Power Delivery negotiation results. 

330µF bulk electrolytic capacitor on power output to smooth power delivery. 

Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection on all inputs. 

38kHz Infrared Remote Receiver (IRM) compatible with all WLED-supported remotes. 

Supports ESP-NOW based remote controls. 

Easy flashing of custom firmware or upgrades through the USB-C connector. 

Pads exposing three ESP32 GPIOs for custom functions. 

Output pads exposed for hardwired solder options. 

Comes with a custom 3D-printed PLA+ case (design files available upon request). 

Comes with JST-SM 3 or 4-pin pigtail connector. 

Comes pre-flashed with the latest version of WLED.
